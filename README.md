# Problem

For bar coupon and coffee coupon offers, what users were more likely to accept (use) the coupon (eg we were able to drive an action to).  Explore what characteristics had the most acceptance, and what patterns we might be able use in the future to drive the most utilization of our coupon marketing campaigns.

# *Final Summary*

Findings: 

1. People that already go to bar once a month are much more likely to accept a bar coupon. No kids, not divorced and under 30 also increase acceptance rate.
2. People with friends or partners headed home or not specific destination, are more likely accept coffee house coupons. Afternoon to evening 2pm to 10pm have the best acceptance rates. 


Hypthosesis: People not alone and not with kids, are more likely to accept because they are looking for entertainment. Targeting when they are headed home or no destination between 2pm and 10pm could increase utilzation (acceptance rate) 

Next Steps:

Explore age and other demographics information to see if we define a tighter cohort.

To validate: Run an experiment target people between 2PM -10pm that are headed home or no destination and not alone, 
Possible analysis to see if there behavior change vs other coupon types around "entertainment": 
1. Coffee coupon vs resturaunt
2. Coffee coupon vs take away/carry out 
3. Coffee coupon vs bar
